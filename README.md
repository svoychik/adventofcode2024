# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository!  

This repository contains my solutions for the **[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)** challenges, written entirely in **Java**. Each dayâ€™s challenge is implemented as a separate class (sometimes part 2 is implemented as a separate class as well), with input files organized in the `resources` folder.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### Folders and Files

- **`src/`**  
  - **Java Code**: Each dayâ€™s solution is implemented in a separate Java file, named as `DayX.java` (e.g., `Day1.java`, `Day10.java`).
  - **Optimized or Extended Solutions**: For some days, additional files like `Day11Optimized.java` or `Day13Pt2.java` provide alternative or part 2 implementations.
- **`src/resources/`**  
  - **Input Files**: Inputs for each dayâ€™s challenge are stored here.  
    - File naming format: `dayX.txt` (e.g., `day1.txt`, `day15.txt`).

---

## Example

For **Day 11**, the structure includes:
- **Solution Files**:
  - `Day11.java` (initial solution)  
  - `Day11Optimized.java` (optimized solution)  
- **Input File**:
  - `src/resources/day11.txt`

The build-run job is configured to solve daily tasks with the provided default input

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/svoychik/adventofcode2024.git
cd adventofcode2024
```
### 2. Set Up Your Environment

- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE

### 3. Run a Specific Dayâ€™s Solution

- Navigate to the corresponding Java file (e.g., `Day10.java`).
- Ensure the input file (e.g., `day10.txt`) exists in the `resources` folder.
- Execute the `main` method of the Java file to see the result
